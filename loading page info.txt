2.	Our purpose is to develop a new major exploration experience for Oregon State University’s  College of Engineering. Our goal is to build upon and expand the resources already available to COE students via Oregon State University’s website.
The team’s vision is to produce a game similar to Uno that provides major information in a unique way. Players will have in their hands major and class cards. Major cards will play as “wild” cards and class cards as “regular” Uno cards, where a player can put down a class card if it is a class that is taken by the current major. These cards will provide detailed information on each respective card that can be highlighted and examined by the students as they play.
3.	First-year students often haven’t explored all the major options available to them in the College of Engineering. These students may seek a unique and entertaining way to become familiar with their options.
4.	There is no competition lol
5.	Documentation will be located within the github repo
